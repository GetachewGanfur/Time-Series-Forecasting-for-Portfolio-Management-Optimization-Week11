# Time Series Forecasting for Portfolio Management Optimization

## Overview
This project implements advanced time series forecasting techniques for portfolio management optimization. It combines statistical models, machine learning approaches, and financial theory to provide robust portfolio allocation strategies.

## Features
- **Multiple Forecasting Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and ensemble methods
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Modern Portfolio Theory, Black-Litterman, and risk-parity approaches
- **Advanced Risk Management**: Historical, Parametric, and Monte Carlo VaR/CVaR calculations
- **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**: ADF stationarity tests, Jarque-Bera normality, Ljung-Box autocorrelation
- **Enhanced Data Processing**: Advanced missing data handling, outlier detection, time-based interpolation
- **Rolling Analytics**: 30-day rolling volatility, rolling Sharpe ratios, dynamic risk metrics
- **Backtesting Framework**: Comprehensive performance evaluation with transaction costs
- **Professional Visualizations**: Efficient frontier, correlation heatmaps, drawdown analysis
- **Real-time Data Integration**: YFinance integration with robust error handling
